Path Finding Visualizer
-----------------------

A simple path finding visualizer.
[Coroutine](https://github.com/BeyondSora/Coroutine), another project of mine,
is used to help implement the tightly coupled graph traversing and rendering
components.

For now, it only supports DFS search to find path. I plan to add various kinds
of path finding algorithm in the future.

[openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) is required to build the
application (however, the binary inside the bin folder should run fine on
Windows without openFrameworks ).
